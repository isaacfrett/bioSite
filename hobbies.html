                            <p> One of Carolyn's hobbies is doing escape rooms with friends. She finds
                                it enjoybale being able to work togehter with people to solve puzzles
                                in a way that's fun and easy going. Escape rooms usually bring out an energetic
                                personality in her as there comes a rush to solve the given puzzles in an 
                                alloted time.

                            <img src="images/axethrowing.png" alt="">  
                            <p>Another one of Carolyn's hobbies is to go to a local hatchet throwing company
                                and wokr her motor skills by throwing axes at a bullsye! While she doesn't get
                                to do this often, it's her favorite physical activity that she enjoys with friends.
                                This can be encapsualted in the idea that Carolyn enjoys trying new things, things that 
                                might be unconvential and uniqiue.

                        <h1>Snowboarding</h1>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Lastly, Carolyn enjoys snowboarding and all that comes with it, the learning process
                                the physicalness, the rush of going down a hill and lots more. She first learned
                                to snowboard only a few years ago but since then she has always enjoyed it and 
                                continues to look forward to the days when she can go again, both time and weather
                                permitting. She thinks it's a great way to get outside and enjoy fresh air on colder
                                days of the year.
