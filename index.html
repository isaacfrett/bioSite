                        <p> Carolyn's biggest motivation in life is to work in the healthcare field 
                            and specifically in patient care. She's always been the type of person that 
                            enjoys helping people face to face and with conditions that are hard for them
                            to overcome on their own. She's worked as a Nursing Assistant in the past and she now
                            has her eyes set on going to Physician’s Assistant school to work in medicine upon graduating.
                            She's passionate about helping others and this is one of the many ways she hopes to be
                            able to help others in the future.

                        <p> Carolyn's accomplishments include being a first generation college student in her family
                            and graduating with two degrees in both Biochemistry and Human Physiology. She did this
                            while holding various leadership positions in a Vietnamese sorority. She currently uses her degrees to
                            work in the DNA manufacturing industry but as mentioned earlier, she hopes to attend
                            Physician’s Assistant school within the year and work in medicine there after.

                        <p>From working in the health field and from her own goals and aspirations,
                            Carolyn is very interested in the fitness field and actively likes to workout, lift weights,
                            participate in physical events like snowboarding and ax throwing. She values physical
                            activity and working out as essential to her overall health and well-being. She 
                            knows that her motivation and drive wouldn't be the same if she didn't actively push
                            herself in all areas of her life.
