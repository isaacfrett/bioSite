                    <div class="about">
                        <p>Carolyn is a person that always wants to make herself and those who are her better 
                            in what they do. She’s uplifting in the fact that her purpose is to help those that 
                            need help whether that be with their health, physical disability, or emotional support, 
                            she always seems to give willingly where it’s needed most. She credit’s this drive to her 
                            upbringing and how she was raised. Her parents, who came from Vietnam before she was born, 
                            raised her with great values and instilled in her a hard work ethic that would later help her 
                            in college. Being a first generation college student, she pushed herself to venture into a 
                            big University where she didn’t know anyone and was away from her family. At college, 
                            she double majored in Biochemistry and Human Physiology and graduated with honors all while 
                            holding leadership roles in her Vietnamese sorority. One of the bigger moments in her life 
                            came after college when she started to work in the field of DNA manufacturing. She gained a 
                            different view on the world when she realized the importance of personal finance and what her 
                            family had provided for her during her upbringing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the future, Carolyn wants to go to graduate school to become a Physician’s Assistant and 
                            spend her time working with patients face to face. She has goals of traveling the world and 
                            exploring new places that she hasn’t been before. She hopes that there’s a possibility that 
                            as she travels she can administer to people all around the world that need help with their 
                            health. She’s persistent about changing the world, and she’s motivated to make an impact 
                            every morning she wakes up. Her big heart and her compassionate spirit is going to better 
                            the lives of so many people in a positive way.
